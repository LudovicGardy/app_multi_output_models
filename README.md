# Multi Output Regression

## üìÑ Overview
üè° This application is a comprehensive multi-output analysis tool that allows you to load datasets, handle multiple target columns, and quickly visualize results.

ü§î It integrates seamlessly into a machine learning workflow by offering an interactive Streamlit interface, suitable for data science or data engineering teams looking to test different scenarios.

You can customize encodings, manipulate various datasets, and extend the application to more advanced regression methods as needed.

## Prerequisites

- **Anaconda or Miniconda**: For easy environment management (optional)
- **Docker** (optional): To run the app in a containerized setup
- **Python 3.12**

## ‚öôÔ∏è Installation and Setup

This project uses **Poetry** for dependency management, which offers an option to create virtual environments directly. You have two choices to set up your environment:

### Option 1: Using Poetry to Create and Manage the Virtual Environment

Poetry can handle the creation and activation of a virtual environment automatically, without needing Conda or other virtual environment tools.

#### Steps

1. **Clone the repository**:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/LudovicGardy/the_project_name
    cd the_project_name
    ```

2. **Install Dependencies and Create the Environment**:
   - If there is no `pyproject.toml` file in your project yet, you can create one using:
     ```bash
     poetry init
     ```

   - Add the libraries you need, for exemple:
     ```bash
     poetry add matplotlib
     ```

   - Run the following command to let `poetry` create an isolated environment and install dependencies directly:
     ```bash
     poetry install --no-root
     ```

3. **Activate the Environment**:
   - Poetry automatically creates a virtual environment, but it may not activate it by default. Use the following command to activate it:
     ```bash
     poetry shell
     ```

4. **Run the Application**:
   1. Classic application
      ```bash
      python main.py
      ```
   2. Streamlit application
      ```bash
      streamlit run main.py
      ```

#### Note on Poetry-managed Environments

Using `poetry install` to create and activate an environment directly is a streamlined approach, making Conda unnecessary. This can be ideal if you want a simple, Python-only virtual environment managed by `poetry`.

### Option 2: Using Conda for Virtual Environment Management

If you prefer using Conda, follow these steps:

#### Steps

1. **Clone the repository**:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/LudovicGardy/the_project_name
    cd the_project_name
    ```

2. **Create and Activate the Conda Environment**:
   - **Using Conda** (recommended):
       ```bash
       conda create -n myenv python=3.11
       conda activate myenv
       ```

3. **Install Dependencies**:
   1. **With Poetry**
   - Once the environment is active, install dependencies within it:
     ```bash
     poetry install --no-root
     ```
   1. **Or with pip**
      ```bash
      pip install -r requirements.txt
      ```

4. **Run the Application**:
   1. Classic application
      ```bash
      python main.py
      ```
   2. Streamlit application
      ```bash
      streamlit run main.py
      ```

### Option 3: Run the App with Docker

If you prefer to run the application in a containerized setup, use Docker.

#### Steps

1. **Prepare Docker environment**
    - Ensure Docker is installed and running on your system.

2. **Navigate to project directory**
    - For multiple containers:
        ```bash
        cd [path-to-app-folder-containing-docker-compose.yml]
        ```
    - For a single container:
        ```bash
        cd [path-to-app-folder-containing-Dockerfile]
        ```

3. **Build the image (if does not already exit)**
    - For multiple containers:
        ```bash
        docker-compose up --build
        ```
    - For a single container:
        ```bash
        docker build -t my-app-title .
        ```

4. **Run the containers**
    - For multiple containers:
        ```bash
        docker run -p 8501:8501 my-app-title
        ```
    - The application will be accessible at `http://localhost:8501`.

5. **Other notes**
    - ‚ö†Ô∏è If you encounter issues with `pymssql`, adjust its version in `requirements.txt` or remove it before building the Docker image.
    - ‚ö†Ô∏è If you encounter issues with `pyspark`, you might need to uninstall and reinstall it. Additionally, ensure that Java is installed and properly configured on your system, as `pyspark` depends on Java. You can install Java by following the instructions on the [official Java website](https://www.java.com/en/download/help/download_options.html). Make sure to set the `JAVA_HOME` environment variable to point to your Java installation directory.

## üß™ Running Unit Tests

Poetry can also manage unit tests to help you verify that the application functions as expected. This project uses **pytest** for testing.

### Setting Up and Running Tests

1. **Add Testing Dependencies**:

   If `pytest` and other test dependencies are not yet added, include them using Poetry:
   ```bash
   poetry add --dev pytest
   ```

2. **Writing Tests**:

   - Place your test files in a `tests` directory at the root of the project.
   - Name your test files following the pattern `test_*.py`.

3. **Running Tests**:

   To run tests within the Poetry environment, use:
   ```bash
   poetry run pytest
   ```

   Alternatively, if you are in an activated Poetry shell (`poetry shell`), you can simply run:
   ```bash
   pytest
   ```

4. **Viewing Test Results**:

   - Test results will appear in the terminal, with a summary of passed, failed, and skipped tests.
   - Use `pytest -v` for more detailed output.
