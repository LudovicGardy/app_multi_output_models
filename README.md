# Multi Output Regression

## üìÑ Overview
üè° This application is a comprehensive multi-output analysis tool that allows you to load datasets, handle multiple target columns, and quickly visualize results.

ü§î It integrates seamlessly into a machine learning workflow by offering an interactive Streamlit interface, suitable for data science or data engineering teams looking to test different scenarios.

You can customize encodings, manipulate various datasets, and extend the application to more advanced regression methods as needed.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Setup & Usage

You can run the application in two ways:

- **Locally using `uv`**
- **Using Docker Compose**

### üîß Option 1 ‚Äî Run Locally with `uv`

> `uv` is a fast and modern Python tool that handles virtual environments and dependencies via `pyproject.toml`.

1. **Install `uv`** (if not already installed)  
   ```bash
   curl -Ls https://astral.sh/uv/install.sh | sh
   ```

2. **Clone the repository**  
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/LudovicGardy/app_name
   cd app_folder/
   ```

3. **Create and activate the environment**  
   ```bash
   uv venv
   ```

   - On **macOS/Linux**:
     ```bash
     source .venv/bin/activate
     ```

   - On **Windows** (PowerShell):
     ```powershell
     .venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1
     ```

4. **(Optional) If the virtual environment doesn't behave properly**

   Sometimes, on macOS in particular, the environment might be missing some tooling (like `pip`). You can try the following fixes:

   ```bash
   .venv/bin/python -m ensurepip --upgrade
   .venv/bin/python -m pip install --upgrade pip
   # Optional: Only if you need to use Jupyter notebooks
   .venv/bin/python -m pip install ipykernel -U --force-reinstall
   ```

5. **Launch the app**  
   ```bash
   streamlit run main.py
   ```

### üê≥ Option 2 ‚Äî Run with Docker Compose

1. **Make sure Docker and Docker Compose are installed and running**

2. **Go to the project directory**
   ```bash
   cd path/to/app_folder
   ```

3. **Build and start the app**
   ```bash
   docker-compose up --build
   ```

4. **Access the app**
   Open your browser at: [http://localhost:8506](http://localhost:8506)
